## I'm from:
[Florianópolis, SC - Brasil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis). One of the most beautiful places in the world. It's a (huge) island in the south of Brasil.

## What I do?
Software. Sometimes good software, sometimes bad software... but I **keep doing and improving.**

I have **passion for backend development/architecture**, but I'm always playing with some frontend, mobile or IoT development.

## Where I'm now?
Nowadays I'm living in Jyväskylä, Finland. It's a Peaceful place with peaceful people.

## Do you need my services?
I'm available for hiring, but:

* I need work remotely (unless if you have an office in Jyväskylä)
* If you don't like automated tests I'm not an option! *Testing* is **quality of life** (mine and yours). Development when only one person make the tests and others mess the tests are not considered.
* If you only have the forethought to have money to pay me I'm not available. **I'm the worst worker when I don't get paid**.
